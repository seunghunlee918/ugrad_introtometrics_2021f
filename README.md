# Introduction to Econometrics (Fall 2021)
This repository contains the TA notes and recitation slides I have used for the 2021 Fall semester. It includes the TeX files for the lecture notes and recitation slides used in Fall 2021 semester. Please contact me (sl4436@columbia.edu) or send a pull request if you spot any errors.

### Book (Will be superceded by the folder with the same name in Fall 2022 version)
This folder contains one TeX file that compiles all topics covered in Introduction to Econometrics class in Columbia University. It combines the materials used in Fall 2019, Spring 2021, and Fall 2021 semesters. 

### Lecture Notes
The following topics are covered at each recitation


|Recitation    |  Topics Covered  |
|--------------|------------------|
|Recitation 1  |  Probability, distributions and statistical inference  |
|Recitation 2  |  Introduction to OLS: Derivation, measure of fitness, sampling distributions, and tests        |
|Recitation 3  |  Extension of OLS: Binary independent variables, heteroskedasticity, multivarite regressions |
|Recitation 4  |  Nonlinear regressors: Implementation and interpretation |
|Recitation 5  |  Assessing regression models: Internal and external validity |
|Recitation 6  |  Panel regression: Fixed effect models   |
|Recitation 7  |  Binary dependent variable models: Linear probability, logit, and probit models  |
|Recitation 8  |  Instrumental variables: IV conditions, estimation, properties, and identification |
|Recitation 9  |  Economics of experiments (Potential outcome framework, DID, RD) and Big data econometrics (Ridge, LASSO, PC) |
|Recitation 10 |  Time series: AR, ADL, stationarity, and Dynamic causal analysis |

For each recitations, there is a code (in .do file) and the dataset for each STATA demonstrations. 

### Recitation Slides
I have made separate slides for each sessions. Each recitation covers roughly the same topic as in the recitation notes.   <br>
